# How-well-you-know-me
This is a quiz I made as a beginner. I used the readlineSync package to have interaction with the user. To make it more user-friendly, I have given options so that the user do not have to type the whole answer. User will have to type the option marker and press enter to give answer. Although I could have used readineSync's KeyInSelect property to give option and made it easier for the user to give answer, I have not used it in this one. Questions asked are actually stupid.
